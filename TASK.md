## Task Management Guidelines

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Critical path items, user safety features, core functionality
- **Medium**: Important features, performance improvements, enhanced UX
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features, optimizations, future enhancements

### Effort Estimation
- **Small**: 1-3 days of development work
- **Medium**: 1-2 weeks of development work  
- **Large**: 2-4 weeks of development work

### Task Dependencies
- Tasks must be completed in dependency order
- Blocked tasks should be escalated immediately
- Cross-team dependencies require coordination

### Completion Criteria
Each task must meet these requirements before being marked complete:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance requirements met (60 FPS animations, <3s load times)
- [ ] Security requirements verified
- [ ] User safety considerations addressed
- [ ] All visual elements created programmatically (no external asset dependencies)

### Risk Management
- All trading-related features require extra security review
- Educational content must be fact-checked and legally compliant
- User financial safety is the highest priority
- Gradual rollout recommended for high-risk features
