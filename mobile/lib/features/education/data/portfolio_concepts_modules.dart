Welcome to Portfolio Kingdom! üè∞

**What is a Portfolio?**
Think of your portfolio as your kingdom's various territories and assets. Just as a wise ruler wouldn't put all their resources in one place, smart investors don't put all their money in one investment!

**Portfolio Components:**

üèÜ **Stocks (Equity Territory)**
These represent ownership in companies. Like owning shares in various businesses across your kingdom. Higher risk, higher potential reward.

üèõÔ∏è **Bonds (Treasury Bonds)**
These are loans you give to governments or companies. Like lending gold to other kingdoms for interest. Lower risk, steady returns.

üè™ **Real Estate (Property Kingdom)**
Physical properties that generate income. Like owning buildings and land in your kingdom that pay rent.

üí∞ **Cash & Cash Equivalents (Royal Treasury)**
Money kept readily available for emergencies and opportunities. Like your kingdom's immediate reserves.

üåæ **Commodities (Trade Goods)**
Physical goods like gold, oil, crops. Like your kingdom's trade in valuable resources.

**The Magic of Diversification:**
By spreading your wealth across different types of assets (territories), you protect your kingdom from disasters that might affect just one area. If one territory struggles, others might thrive!

**Visual Learning:**
The pie chart shows a balanced portfolio allocation. Notice how the wealth is spread across different asset types to minimize risk while maximizing growth potential.

Every wise ruler must understand the eternal balance! ‚öñÔ∏è

**The Risk-Return Principle:**
In the financial kingdom, there's a fundamental law: higher potential returns usually come with higher risk. You can't get something for nothing!

**Understanding Risk Levels:**

üü¢ **Low Risk (Safe Territories)**
- Government bonds, savings accounts
- Predictable returns but lower growth
- Like well-established, peaceful provinces

üü° **Medium Risk (Developing Lands)**
- Balanced funds, dividend stocks
- Moderate growth with some volatility
- Like expanding into new but stable regions

üî¥ **High Risk (Frontier Territories)**
- Growth stocks, startups, crypto
- High potential returns but high volatility
- Like exploring uncharted lands - great rewards but danger!

**Kingdom Wisdom:**
- Young rulers (investors) can take more risk - time heals wounds
- Older rulers need more stability - preserve wealth for the future
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- Diversification is your royal guard against catastrophe

**The Chart Shows:**
How different investment types sit on the risk-return spectrum. Higher up means more potential return, further right means more risk.

**How It Works:**
1. Drag the sliders to allocate your wealth
2. Watch the pie chart update in real-time
3. See how your allocation affects expected return and risk
4. Try the preset portfolios for different life stages

**Key Metrics:**
- **Expected Return**: Average annual growth you might expect
- **Risk Level**: How much your portfolio value might fluctuate
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Return per unit of risk (higher is better)

**Portfolio Rules:**
- Total allocation must equal 100%
- Each asset has limits based on typical recommendations
- Higher risk assets have higher potential returns

**Kingdom Wisdom:**
- Younger rulers can take more risk for growth
- Older rulers should prioritize capital preservation
- Regular rebalancing maintains your target allocation
- Don't put all your eggs in one basket!

Even the best-planned kingdoms need maintenance! üîß

**What is Rebalancing?**
Rebalancing is like reorganizing your kingdom to maintain the right balance of resources. When some investments grow faster than others, your portfolio allocation changes from what you originally planned.

**Example: The Drift Problem**
Let's say you started with:
- 60% Stocks
- 40% Bonds

After a year, stocks performed really well (+20%) while bonds stayed flat (0%). Now your portfolio is:
- 67% Stocks (much higher!)
- 33% Bonds (much lower!)

**Why Rebalance?**

üéØ **Maintains Your Risk Level**
Prevents your portfolio from becoming riskier than intended.

üí∞ **Forces "Buy Low, Sell High"**
You sell assets that have grown (sell high) and buy assets that haven't (buy low).

‚öñÔ∏è **Keeps You Disciplined**
Prevents emotional decisions based on market trends.

üõ°Ô∏è **Risk Management**
Ensures you don't accidentally become over-concentrated in one asset.

**When to Rebalance:**
- Time-based: Every 6-12 months
- Threshold-based: When any asset drifts 5-10% from target
- Life event-based: When your goals or timeline changes

**How to Rebalance:**
1. Check your current allocation
2. Compare to your target allocation
3. Sell overweight assets
4. Buy underweight assets
5. Return to target allocation

The chart shows how different rebalancing strategies perform over time!
