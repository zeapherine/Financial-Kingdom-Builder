The basic force that determines all prices.

‚Ä¢ Bid: Highest price someone is willing to pay to buy
‚Ä¢ Ask: Lowest price someone is willing to accept to sell
‚Ä¢ Spread: Difference between bid and ask prices
‚Ä¢ Narrow spread: Very liquid, easy to trade
‚Ä¢ Wide spread: Less liquid, harder to trade

**Volume** üìä
The number of shares traded in a given period.
‚Ä¢ High Volume: Lots of trading activity, strong interest
‚Ä¢ Low Volume: Little trading activity, less interest
‚Ä¢ Volume + Price Movement: Confirms trend strength

Total value of all company shares.
‚Ä¢ Large Cap: 10+ billion dollars (stable, established companies)

‚Ä¢ Small Cap: 300M-2B dollars (smaller, potentially faster-growing)

**P/E Ratio** üîç

‚Ä¢ Industry Comparison: Compare P/E ratios within same industry

**Dividend** üí∞
